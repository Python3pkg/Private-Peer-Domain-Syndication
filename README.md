Private-Peer-Domain-Syndication:
Open source and semi-centralized replacement to traditional domain registration and distrobution.
This repo is meant only to be a proof-of-concept, as it has no contibutors capable of completing the project. PPDS is ment to be a drop-in challenger to traditional domain serving and registration. It seeks to completely remove the commercial and govermeantal reliance of domain spaces, and make domain resolution a truely user controled process.
