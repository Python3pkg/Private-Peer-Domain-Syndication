The Private-Peer-Domain-Syndication Manifesto:

PPDS is an open-source and semi-centralized replacement to traditional domain registration and distribution methods. This repo is meant only to be a proof-of-concept, as it currently has no contributors capable of completing the project. PPDS is meant to be a drop-in challenger to traditional domain serving and registration. It seeks to completely remove the commercial and governmental reliance of domain spaces, and make domain resolution and registration a user controlled and user regulated process. Domain name servers are replaced by RSS-queue domain aggregators that can be created and maintained by anyone. It is their responsibility to map domain names to their respective IP address, but they can choose to map any domain to any address they wish. Users of PPDS can also subscribe to other people's domain aggregators, and these aggregations are downloaded in full or in part to their computer. Requests for these domains are resolved locally whenever possible, minimizing the amount of outgoing information related to their browsing activity. Users can enable multiple aggregators at once if they want, and users decide how domains duplicated between more than one aggregator are handled. The goal of the project is to make domain names an openly managed and accessible resource.
